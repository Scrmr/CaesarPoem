        <h1>Probability Game 2</h1>

        Press A or D to begin.

        <p>Inspired by Aarsons Oracle, this "game" uses a Q-learning algorithm to predict what you'll press next.</p>
        <p>The goal is to have the algorithm's prediction accuracy be around 50% after at least 100 button presses (the more you press, the more accurate the algorithm becomes). 
        Try to be as random as possible - do you have free will, or will a simple algorithm predict your next move?</p>
